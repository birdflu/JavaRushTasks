# This is Wireshark 'manuf' file, which started out as a subset of Michael
# Patton's list and grew from there. The Wireshark list and Michael's list
# were merged in 2016.
#
# In the event of data set collisions the Wireshark entries have been given
# precedence, followed by Michael Patton's, followed by the IEEE.
#
# This file is in the same format as ethers(4) except that vendor names
# are truncated to eight characters when used with Wireshark, and
# that well-known MAC addresses need not have a full 6 octets and may
# have a netmask following them specifying how many bits of the address
# are relevant (the other bits are wildcards).  Also, either ":", "-",
# or "." can be used to separate the octets.
